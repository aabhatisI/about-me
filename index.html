        <h2>My first Mini project</h2>
        <h3>Introduction </h3>
        <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/75/b0/a9/75b0a9c28b8e5c8f1a27bb70bab22cc9.jpg">
    <p> If you came to this website you are either looking at what your student/you made, a smart person who want to check if they made the cut, or you are actually not smart. Either way, I will teach you how to be smart and prove that you are not. Sorry in advance.</p>
    <br><h3> Do well in school </h3>
        <p>  Look, I know most of you want to learn how to do well in school, you only need to read this chapter and move on. Unless you want to get into Harvard. In that case, read (almost)everything.</p>
        <br><p> There are three <b>prime</b> steps to do well in school:
            <br>1. reduce- only do what's needed
            <br>2. let go of all-or-nothing
            <br>3. try- aim for good grades but remember to be satisfied with the grades you get</p>
            <p>     You did it? Good. You are now not dumb. </p>
                <br><h3> Do extracurriculars </h3>
                <br><p>  Remember those Harvard dreamers we mentioned at the begining? Colleges look for not only those with good grades, but also extraciraculars. Here are some extracirriculars to prove your smartness:
                    <br> 1. Language Learning
                    <br> 2. Coding with <abbr title="Hypertext markup language">HTML</abbr> and/or other languages.
                    <br> 3. Math for a grade above you
                    <br> 4. What do you want to be when you grow up? There's a club for that.</p>
                    <br><h2> Don't be a sucker</h2>
                    <p> What do I mean don't be sucker? You are the smartest person in the universe! How dare I call you a sucker?! Calm down. You're not the smartest person in the universe. You know youtube? Sometimes youtubers exaggerate and don't actually help. DO NOT BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU SEE!!! Sorry. But be careful with what you trust.</p>
                    <br><h3> Get into Harvard </h3>
                    <br><p> If you followed my advice, you probably got into Harvard. Good for you! Now you just attend and suck as much knowledge as possible. You didn't get in? Any private school can do.</p>
                    <br><h3>Get a high paying job</h3>
                    <br><p> Since you are a Ivy-Leaguer, you will probably get an intership to a high-paying job since you can take lots of work. Search up for them or follow your passion. 
                        <h3> Accept that you don't know everything</h3>
                        New things will leave you intrigued, after all, the world doesn't stop, and so does your fun quest for knowledge! Your training is <q>completed</q></p>
                        <h3 style="text-align:center"> The <q>End</q></h3>
